			<h1 style="line-height: 45px">Students from Queens, New York work to prevent the spread of illnesses at their school.</h1>
			We are proud to announce the winners of DFC USA 2018 - catalyzed by local health issues in their school community, students from PS 135Q (The Bellaire School) in New York City used design thinking to address the root cause of healthy hygiene. As they learned more about the issues and brainstormed solutions, they were motivated to create change both in their community and internationally. See what these young change-makers did here. Watch their amazing story <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_q-K3mLhPQ" target="_new">here</a>.
 			<br/><br/>
 			Each year, DFC hosts a global conference inviting student change makers from over 45+ countries to share their ideas for a better world, and to celebrate what it means to "be the change!" Teams submit projects that are evaluated by industry experts. Several student teams submit to the DFC Challenge, but only one is selected from EACH country to attend the global conference, this year, in Madrid Spain (Nov 2017).
