            Coaching offers individual educators or entire organizations the ability
            to co-create a development plan for mastering the Design for Change
            methodology. With coaching, educators determine the frequency and types
            of learning experiences that will best support their students and lead
            to the desired outcomes. Coaching plans are a combination of in-person
            workshops or feedback sessions, virtual coaching calls, resource
            development, and other customized learning opportunities.
